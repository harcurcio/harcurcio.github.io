            <h1>Developing a Game with Unity</h1>
            <p>Unity is the world's most popular game development engine. It runs on the C# language and is decently
                beginner-friendly with endless amounts of learning material available on its website.</p>
            <p>You can download C# here and Unity <a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download">here</a>. You can
                either download the Student or Personal version of Unity, both are free.</p>
            <h2>Unity</h2>
            <p>Once you have unity up and running, click the new project button.</p>
            <p>Name it under the project name section, and choose if it will be 2d or 3d under template.</p>
            <p>Once you are in the project window, click on the layout dropdown at the top right of the interface.</p>
            <p>Select the 2 by 3 option. This is the most commonly used layout option because you can see all the
                different windows at once, but feel free to play around and find a view that you like the most.</p>
            <h3>The Windows</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Hierarchy Window</li>
                <p>Lists all the current GameObjects actively used in your game. All scenes will start with a Main
                    Camera and a Directional Light.</p>
                <li>Project Window</li>
                <p>Contains all the assets used by your game, you can organize these by folders such as Materials or
                    Scripts.</p>
                <li>Inspector Window</li>
                <p>Lets you configure/modify any GameObject. Selecting a GameObject in the hierarchy lists all the
                    objects components and properties in inspector window.
                    Some properties are position, physics, C# scripts attached to objects.
                </p>
                <li>Scene View</li>
                <p>The screen you use to edit the visual aspects of your game.</p>
                <li>Game View</li>
                <p>How the player will see your game.</p>
            </ul>
            <h3>Making and Manipulating your GameObject</h3>
            <p>To create your first GameObject, to go GameObject > 3D Object > Cube in the toolbar at the top of the
                page.</p>
            <p>To add functionality, click on the Assets folder in the Project window. In the Assets folder, right click
                and go to Create > C# Script.</p>
            <p>This will load up your text editor, where you will write your C# code. Once you are done writing the
                code, you can just save and exit out of the text editor window.</p>
            <p>Back in the main window, drag and drop your script onto the GameObject (in the hierarchy window) you
                would like it to affect.</p>
            <h3>Running Your Game</h3>
            <p>To run your game as a test, click on the Play button at the top-middle of the window. Soon, your game
                will start in the Game View window, and you can play it with the controlls you initialized.</p>
